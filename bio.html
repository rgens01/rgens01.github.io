			Russell is a hopeful young person looking to make a difference in this world.
			He is especially compelled by how the way we produce, distribute and consume food
			contributes to social inequity and environmental harm. By majoring in Computer Science
			and studying Food Systems, Nutrition & the Environment in the Environmental
			Studies Department at Tufts, he hopes to stumble across some innovative,
			people-driven solutions to some of the issues surrounding our food systems.
