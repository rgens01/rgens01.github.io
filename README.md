README: HW1

1) To the best of my knowledge, all aspects of this project have been
implemented correctly

2) While working on this project I spoke about design choices and what was
working or not working with Isaiah Fischer-Brown and Brian Taintor. Along with
these discussions I exchanged snapchats about how the project was going with 
my main main and roommate from last year Josh White.

3) I wager I spent approximately 8-10 hours working on this assignment in total.
